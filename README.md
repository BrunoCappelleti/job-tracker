# Project Overview

Project still a work in progress, but deployed location and installation information will be listed here upon completion.

## Project Description

This app should help job seekers organize their information in a more digestible format. Finding a job becomes a full-time job, and the large amount of data that comes with that can hard to keep track of. This app aims to address this issue by helping users to parse that information more easily.

### MVP/PostMVP

The MVP for this project should include 3 major sections: A welcome page that will introduce the app as well as allow new or returning users to register and login respectively. A job list page that outlines all companies and the position a user has interest in as well as a summary of the users personal information. A job page that outlines a specific job with current status and information, notes, and potential meetings. Post MVP should help the users schedule their time better by sending alerts via email about upcoming meetings or remainders to contact potential leads.

#### MVP Outline
- Ensure CRUD operation for users, jobs, notes, and meetings are working
- User authentication should be working properly
- Overall user experience and flow should feel natural
- Data should be displayed in a stylized fashion using CSS

#### PostMVP Outline

- Implementation of email notification service
- Ensure all notification based features are styled accordingly
- Allow users to set up custom alerts
